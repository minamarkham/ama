# Ask Me Anything

Hi, Iâ€™m Mina. :wave: Use this repository to _ask me anything_.

* [Ask a question](https://github.com/minamarkham/ama/issues/new)
* [Read answers](https://github.com/minamarkham/ama/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed)

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means anything. Personal. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.  
I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it.

**Guidelines**

- Ensure your question hasn't [already been answered](https://github.com/minamarkham/ama/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed).
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).
- Be civil and polite.
